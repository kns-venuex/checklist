- [ ] Color Palette  
We prefer to set the project's colors first. We'd like to have the shades and tints of every main color on our palette. These main colors are named after their purpose; primary, gray-scale, success, danger, warning, info along with optional secondary and tertiary. We usually have ~7 main colors but it is optional to add more.

- [ ] Typography Scheme  
We usually set a type-scale of 13 sizes for every project. 

- [ ] Responsive Layouts  
We generally use 12 column grids with 8 or 16 gutters on each side.

- [ ] Button Themes  
Designer should define and properly label the states of every button on the style guide.

- [ ] Iconography  
Every icon used on the UI should be shown in the style guide.

- [ ] Form Elements  
Form elements should cover every possible state of every actionable form elements.

- [ ] Components  
Cards, bars, accordions, carousels.. Every component should be clearly stated in the style guide.
