- [ ] Read the issue carefully  
Understanding the briefing is a crucial step. You can always disucss the details with the team for better understanding the issue.

- [ ] Give a time estimation to the task  
Estimations are hard, that is why they are called estimations. You'll get better at it over time. 

- [ ] Change the status of the Jira issue from “To-Do“ to “In-Progress“  
It means you also need to start tracking your time, some use [Clockify](https://clockify.me/), some use [Chronos](https://chronos.web-pal.com/). No matter which tool you use, we expect everyone on the team to track their working time. 

- [ ] Create a branch on Abstract  
We use Abstract for version controlling and design handoffs. Create a branch named with the jira issue id (e.g. CHECK-54/Add-New-Category). 

- [ ] Provide the needs of the given task  
It is always a good idea to brainstorm with the other designers on the team.

- [ ] Commit early and often  

- [ ] Keep the design consistent and accessible  
You should follow the [UI Style Guide](/checklist/essentials-of-ui-style-guide) of the project and make sure the new contributions are compatible with the rest of the design.

- [ ] Make sure you have met the acceptance criteria  

- [ ] Design Review  
Design review is a crucial part of our design workflow. Every design should be reviewed and approved by the other designers on the team, so after the last commit you should add other designers as reviewers(on Abstract).

- [ ] Inform the design team  
Inform the design team about the task you have worked on, give them contexts so that every designer on the team can be on the same page.

- [ ] Merge the branch to master  
Don't forget to apply the changes from design review if there was any.

- [ ] Create an Abstract collection  
We use collections feature of Abstract, you should create a new collection named with the Jira issue #id-number and add related artboards to it.

- [ ] Change the status of the Jira issue from “In-Progress“ to “Review“  
Also please provide the Abstract collection link of the design. 

- [ ] Assign the project's manager to the task  

- [ ] Stop your time tracker ✊
