Do not use right now

- [ ] Start with the user story  
User story is a brief explanation of what you're going to explain. 

- [ ] Check the user story is in the format of ‚ÄúAs a [persona], I [want to], [so that].‚Äù   
It is quite helpful for defining done.

- [ ] Break down the user story in description section, if needed  
You may want to give more detail about the persona or the aim of the story. 

- [ ] Include all the text content in the description section  
Even the design or attachments have the correct content, you should write them down.

- [ ] Continue with the acceptance criterias (AC)  
AC's are set of statements, each with a clear pass/fail result, that specify both functional and non-functional requirements. In other words, AC's is the key for definition of done.

- [ ] Explain the expected behaviour in scenarios section  
Try to cover all edge scenarios along with the happy path. You may want to get help from Gherkin Scenario's.

- [ ] Add all relavent attachments
