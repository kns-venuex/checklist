description: We request the worklog from the team at the end of every day. So that, we can follow our performance (man/day) in each project and we call it "CRM". Follow the steps for the perfect CRM sharing! 
---

- [ ] Write the project's name that you're working on as title  
If you worked in multiple projects, we expect you to report them separately.

- [ ] Specify your worklog for each project  
Use marks of 15 minutes.

- [ ] Specify the tasks/issues you have worked  
You should specify it with key-id and title that are taken from Jira. So that everyone in the VenueX might have an idea about what you're doing.

- [ ] Write down the status of your issues like "Done", "In Progress"

- [ ] It would be better to include Turkish characters while writing CRM  

- [ ] Check that the total time is equal to 7.30 hours  
We are counting the time over 7.30 hours.
