- [ ]  Select photos and edit if necessary, then create the social media plan for the upcoming weeks.    
The concepts and frequency may change in times of conferences, special days, projects going live and adding new job posts. We generally plan for upcoming two weeks but the general content may overleap to four weeks.

- [ ]  Determine the accounts that the content will be posted to:  
Depending on the concept of the content, the channels we post to may differ such as; posting a fun company event video on Instagram Stories whereas updating LinkedIn on a new published job post.

- [ ]  Description, Emojis and Hashtags  
The language we prefer to use on VenueX accounts are very friendly and warm. The descriptions preferably should not extend to more than three sentences. We use emojis like sunglasses, punch and party often. Hashtag #atolye15 is used in all of our content. Extra usage of hashtags depend on the subject matter.

- [ ]  Provide location  
We use our location tag in all our content related to our office.

- [ ]  Keep constant track of feedback: comments, likes and direct messages  
Answer direct messages, and reply back to comments on the regular.
