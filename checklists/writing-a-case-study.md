description: The checklist we abide by when we write a case study about a new project.
---

-  [ ] Explain the project  
Create a summary of the project to provide its reader with necessary general information.

- [ ] Define the problem  
We need to make sure that we cover all problems/challanges about the project in the case study.  

- [ ] Emphasize why we are good for the job  
Explain why the customer has chosen us for the project.  

- [ ] Summary (Overview) image  
Remember to include an overview image that simply demonstrates the projects overall progress in the case study.  

- [ ] Include how we approached the problems and what kind of solutions we had to offer  
Write down the struggles and needs of the project, including our approach to these problems and our final solution.  

- [ ] Include wireframes/prototypes and imagery  
We generally talk about our prototyping process and share information/visuals if necessary.  

- [ ] Mention implementing design to code phase  
Make sure to include how we proceed from design phase to coding for the mentioned project and emphasize the problems on coding (if there is any).  

- [ ] Write down the product launch phase and the beneficial information and stats related to the product  
One of the most important points to consider when writing a case study is providing the reader with qualified information of how we have accomplished certain tasks for the product.  

- [ ] Remember to include user feedback and related data to have a concrete perception  
Having detailed information and feedback about the product is important, so make sure to have user feedback regardless of project is an ongoing one or not.
