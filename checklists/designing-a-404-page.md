- [ ] Make navigation possible  
If someone ends up on the 404 page, it means they are lost on the site. Make it possible for them to navigate. 

- [ ] Clearly state the error message  
Describe the reason why the user may have landed on this page.

- [ ] Add a CTA button  
On most cases this could be linked to home page or contact.

- [ ] Create an illustration  
It's not necessarily a must but always nice to have. Show your brand's personality by creating a 404 illustration. You can refer to our [illustration checklist](/checklist/creating-ui-illustrations).
